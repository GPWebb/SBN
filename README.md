SBN Application CMS &copy; Alpine Red Ltd.

SBN provides a platform to develop secure web applications and APIs. Pages and datasets can be optionally cached for performance, and automatically generated by the accompanying database project based on database metadata.

Test coverage is presently lacking because I haven't had the time to dedicate to that over feature development of SBN and it hosted applications. In reality they make it close enough to self-testing for now, but tests should be added soon.
